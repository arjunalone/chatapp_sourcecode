This is a simple application that demonstrates message transfer under the same IP address, along with basic security measures including encryption, decryption, and key hashing.

🔐 Security Note:
The same key is used for both encryption and decryption to keep the implementation simple.

🌐 IP Address Requirement:
Both the sender and receiver must be on the same IP address.
If they are not, please check the ip_address in the source code and update it accordingly.
